# Policy Zone Update
Policy zones shared between the Fleet Management System (FMS) and the Autonomous Haulage System (AHS) shall be treated as immutable and as such, update calls are not supported.

To update a policy zone, the Fleet Management System (FMS) shall delete the existing policy zone, and create a new policy zone with the new updated information.
